      <h1>Stage 5 &amp; 6 Engineering Resource Hub</h1>
      <p class="lead">
        A central home for engineering curriculum maps, project sequences, and classroom-ready learning experiences.
        The layout mirrors the Construction hub so staff can transition seamlessly as bespoke Engineering materials go live.

      <h3 id="callout-heading">Welcome to the Engineering build</h3>
      <p>
        The documents below have been migrated from faculty planning folders so that everything needed for Stage 5 and Stage 6
        Engineering studies sits alongside the Construction suite. The hub is designed for scale: every card will eventually map
        to multi-part modules, downloadable resources, and embedded media in the same style as Construction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use the quick links to jump to curriculum documentation, view developing project pathways, and access curated teaching
        resources. Feedback on structure and prioritised inclusions is encouraged while the hub takes shape—sections flagged as
        “in development” will light up automatically as new assets are uploaded.
